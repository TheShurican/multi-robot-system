# Logistic-Robot-System-LRS

Development of a system where two mobile robots interact to fulfill a transportation order. The order includes the pick up location, the exchange location and the destined location.

One Robot  strictly communicates over a web interface.
The other robot's communication is handled by a ROS node.
The server servers as a central unit to give out the orders to the robots and monitor the process. Furthermore, it will compute optimal time frames, so that the exchange process proceeds flawlessly without any waiting times
